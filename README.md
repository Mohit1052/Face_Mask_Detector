# Face_Mask_Detector
This project is based on OpenCv,Convolutional Neural Network,Caffe-based face Detector,Keras Models,TensorFlow and on python language..  

Our face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the simple Sequential Model architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.). 

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19.  This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines.
